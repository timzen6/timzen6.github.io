# About page

I am currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at Ailio. My focus is on helping improve organisations by better utilising their data. I contribute to these transformation projects by bringing in my broad expertise in data related topics ranging from data engineering and cloud-development (AWS, Azure) over data science and machine learning to communication and leadership skills.

After completing my masters in chemistry, I really started my journey in the data science and machine learning field during my PhD studies in theoretical chemistry. The next step for me was a role as a data scientist in a company developing software in the IT-Security field. For five years, I worked on a system to detect suspicious e-mail traffic using machine learning. Set aside the technical aspect of the job, I also built a small team. From this experience I learnt a lot about leadership and developing software products on a larger scale.

I strongly believe that using the right data to inform important decisions helps organisations of all kinds improve. However, often this is easier said than done. I am always curios to discover and tackle these interesting challenges. Also, I am more than happy to sharing my knowledge and learnings. 

If you want to talk about any interesting projects or problems feel free to reach out to me. I really enjoy discussing technical insights and ideas. I try to share some of my ideas regularly and I enjoy speaking publicly about topics related to Data Science, AI, Leadership, and Learning in general. So, if you are looking for a speaker on these topics, donâ€˜t hesitate to contact me.
