<p>Summer time, reading time: The power of a great story</p>

<p>For me, summer holidays have always been the time of reading more than usual. It is the combination of time off (from work or uni or school for that matter) and reading more that feels like a great source of creativity and new motivation.</p>

<p>One thing I learned over time is to broaden the view when curating one‘s summer reading list. It is a great chance to get on an intellectual journey. While sometimes it is a good idea to choose your books with a very well defined focus - if you want to learn something new or refresh the knowledge on a certain topic - you could indeed miss out if you only read for immediate benefit. Sometimes we just don’t know what we don’t know (yet!). So it is important to give new topics and ideas a chance.</p>

<p>I want to share some of the insights and recommendations from my summer readings from this year. I want to start with the book Restless by William Boyd.</p>

<p>First of all, I am always a fan of a great spy story and this one certainly is. It is a great read and an immersive story. The main character works as a spy for a English intelligence service before and during the second world war. Looking at world history through a totally different perspective than in typical history books fascinates me.</p>

<p>I don’t want to go into too much detail about the story. There will be no spoilers, but what I can say is that the book sheds light on the informational warfare during the second world war. The intelligence services of all major factions go at great lengths to spread disinformation and alter the public opinion e.g. in the US. The technical tools are quite different from those available today, but the general strategies are still quite similar. The book gives great lessons on how to deal carefully with information and how to operate in very uncertain environments.</p>

<p>One general theme of many spy novels for me is thinking outside the box. Spy life often seems quite different from normal life, so it is quite obvious that spy-thinking should be different, too. In this story the spies often find themselves in dire situations - real do or die if you will. Fortunately, the everyday world is usually not like this. However, when thinking about difficult situations or decisions, two questions derived from the spy setting proved very helpful for me as a thought experiment: 
What would I do if this one problem was the only thing I care about?
How would I solve the problem if I had all resources of the world (like spy agencies) at hand?</p>

<p>It helps to change the perspective and to find new solutions this way. As mentioned before, I highly recommend reading for sparking creativity.</p>

<p>What book did you read lately, that was not work related? I am always grateful for recommendations.</p>
