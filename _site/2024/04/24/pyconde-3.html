    <h1>PyConDe 2024 - Day 3</h1>
<p>Posted on 24 Apr 2024</p>
<p>Original language: english</p>

<p>PyCon DE &amp; PyData 2024 is in the books and it was a great experience for me. It provided lots of new input and ideas. Coming home from a good conference is often somewhat magical for me. There is so much new motivation and I could start eight different new projects right away.</p>

<p>The first two days (see in earlier posts) provided some great new tools and technical ideas for me. The third day was different, it was more about the bigger picture. So the right order before having time to think on the train ride home.</p>

<p>Ricardo Baeza-Yates gave a great keynote about responsible AI. Considering all the current hype around all things AI he posed the really important questions. I would recommend the talk when it becomes publicly available also to everyone outside the Python/Data Science …-bubble. There are so much gems to find in this talk. One short remark about “how some of our brightest minds mostly optimize advertisement on the web” got me thinking deeply about our society on the way back home.</p>

<p>Speaking about society there was another great session on the last day that sadly did not get the attention aka. a full auditorium as it deserves. In the Panel Challenging Narratives in Tech Feminism Naa Ashiorkor Nortey, Cheuk Ting Ho, Paloma Oliveira and more did a great job raising the important questions and talking about wins and challenges especially in the PyLadies community. The discussion really caught me as it contained so much insights in just an hour. My takeaways are far to many for a short post but here are some of my most important once:
The most important quality when it comes to discussing disparities is empathy. You cannot (and don’t have to) make all experiences by yourself. So for discussing sensitive topics it is important that we all try our best to listen actively and be empathetic.
We especially need to encourage people form underrepresented groups that they can be part e.g. of the tech-community, too. Especially when it comes to being a more inclusive community it is important to show that “Tech-projects” are way more than sitting in a room alone and hacking away some code. In my opinion most projects that fail do not fail, because there is not enough technical knowledge. A good team needs a much broader skillset. We need more communication, we need more creativity, and we need more points of view.</p>
