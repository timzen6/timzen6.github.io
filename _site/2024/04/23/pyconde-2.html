    <h1>PyConDe 2024 - Day 2</h1>
<p>Posted on 23 Apr 2024</p>
<p>Original language: english</p>

<p>With two of three days of an exciting PyCon DE &amp; PyData here are my highlights and key learnings of day 2 of the conference.</p>

<p>We heard two interesting keynotes looking at open source work from different angles. The talks of Hannes MÃ¼hleisen reminded me of some aspects of my PhD studies and that good software development is unfortunately not valued much in the academic world. In my opinion this is a problem that needs to be addressed more broadly and the talks gave some hints how to do so.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the talk by Thomas Fraunholz suggested embracing Dev Containers in Python development. I am curious to test this more and think that this technique can improve our Development at 32Guards. I especially liked the speakers motivation to keep every listener in the loop.</p>

<p>One real highlight of the conference especially when considering the pure speaking performance was the talk by Marco Gorelli about Polars and Time Series. Besides great speaking (and acting) skills the talk also delivered with regard to the content as well. I really encouraged to use polars for all kinds of data manipulation and motivated me to look deeper into it.</p>

<p>The first two days of hashtag#PyConDe were a blast so far. I am now really excited for the final day.</p>
