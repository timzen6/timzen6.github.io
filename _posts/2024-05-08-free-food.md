Why do millionaires get free food?

In school, languages and reading and discussing fiction books seemed of no real value for me. I think this is a general tendency for people more drawn to the STEM-field. When I finally got more into reading (after school) I gravitated more towards non-fiction.
However, the more I get into reading fiction, the more I realise that it is often a much more powerful way to transport insights and ideas using a great story rather than pure facts. This should be by no means a statement to ignore facts when there is a good story, but often a well-told story is a good start to get motivated and thinking about a certain topic.


On the weekend I finished reading “Free Food for Millionaires” by Min Jin Lee. 

It was a great read about the life of several characters of the Korean-American Community in the late 90s. The struggles of the characters give insights into various aspects of social hierarchy and how the upbringing and family background influences career paths.
One conflict throughout the book is the balance between the traditional values and the integration into the American society. As this is hard enough most of the characters, especially the second generation immigrants, mange this fairly well. The real insider vs outsider dynamic depends much more the economic background of the family. Whereas the characters from lower-class families, regardless of their ethnicity, struggle to be successful, the characters from a upper-class background capitalise on their privileges. Not only in the career, it is hard to climb the social ladder, but also the success can be a burden for the family relationships, especially between parents and their better of children.
One lesson I took from this was to refocus when thinking of diversity. In my opinion the social background is often overlooked as a really important factor. It may determine the career paths and success in life immensely. When it comes to e.g. education, work, and politics the current systems are highly socially selective. It does not have to be this way.

In the book, the characters who climb the social ladder have to build their professional networks from scratch, are often less likely to ask for favours, and cannot easily afford to make risky career decisions (with big potential upsides). On the other they often bring in different skills and experience. They know how to deal with obstacles and go through hardship, tend to be more loyal, and have easier time to be empathetic as they know both sides.


In my opinion we need to build better systems and organisations to work against social selection. It is very valuable to have a diverse set of backgrounds in any team. But we can also learn and embrace things the millionaires in the book already know to get all their free food: Ask for favours, help others to get ahead, and take risks.
