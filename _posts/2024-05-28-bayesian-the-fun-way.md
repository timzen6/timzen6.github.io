What do Legos, Star Wars, and Rubber Ducks have to do with Bayesian Statistics?

A few days ago, I finished reading “Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way” by Will Kurt. I am not a beginner when it comes to Bayesian Statistics, but I enjoyed reading the book a lot. When it comes to theory I did not pick up anything totally new. However, the book provided some great examples for teaching or thinking about Bayesian Statistics.


In my opinion, there is a great value in reading and learning about the basics in topics we are already far more advanced in. It solidifies our knowledge, let us see new connections, and it gives us new ideas how to teach and explain things to newcomers.

In this regard Will Kurt’s book really shines in my opinion. There are three aspects I liked a lot:

Creative Examples

The selection of the examples in the book is great. The sometimes hilarious stories help a lot to keep the different lessons in mind. Moreover, it is far more motivating reading a funny story while learning about priors, likelihoods, and distributions. My highlight was definitely the Star Wars example where we learn to quantify how badass Han Solo really is.

Selection and Arrangement

Compared to more elaborate textbooks, the selection and sequencing of topics seems unconventional. In the end the goal of a book is more to give the reader a first glimpse at the essential concepts of Bayesian Statistics in less than 200 pages. To achieve this task, it has to make some shortcuts and tell the story differently than in a typical statistics class. For instance, I like how the book mainly sticks to the Beta-Distribution to explain most concepts. It is easy to handle and we can use it to describe many problems that are easy to grasp.

Trim Math down to the basics

The book provides mathematical notation and important formulas. This helps to make the explanations less hand-wavy. However, there is only as much math as needed and the formulas and notations are explained very carefully. I think as experts we often try to explain topics with great mathematical rigor. While this “everything at once” approach might be time efficient, it is very hard for the learner. If the concepts are already clear, notation and rigorous deduction are much easier to understand. The book is a great example for this kind of “concept first” approach.

Generally, these three aspects are key ingredients for good teaching and we should embrace them more. If you want to start learning about Bayesian Statistics or probability and statistics in general, this book is a great start. If you just want to know what it is about the Legos and Han Solo, read the book as well.
